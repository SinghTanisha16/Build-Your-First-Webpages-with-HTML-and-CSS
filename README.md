# Build Your First Webpages with HTML and CSS
## By OpenClassrooms (Tracks provided by Facebook Developer Circles)

The best part of this course was that there was no prior coding experience required. The learning goals as from the [website](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) were:
* Build a first web page with HTML and CSS
* Distinguish between HTML and CSS and identify their separate uses
* Identify and apply correct syntax for common HTML elements
* Explain how semantic HTML tags are used to structure a web page
* Use tags and attributes to identify key information within a page
* Identify and use correct CSS syntax
* Apply CSS to HTML elements

I recommend you to first complete the track and then looking to the solution files. These files are downloaded after completing the 'Let's Code' given in the chapter and then look out for solution if you think the solution is not correct.

I have provided with **RAR (.rar)** files. Before accessing the files, you need to extract it using winrar or any other suitable extractor. I recommend using WinRar. You can download it from [here](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0).

To extract, just install WinRar. After installation, right click on the file and click on 'extract here' option. THe file will be extractes in the form of a folder.

#### Happy Coding!
